Clicking <b>Evaluate</b> causes the program to score the alignment.<p> 
Right-clicking on the sequence inserts a gap at the click-point, while left-clicking closes the nearest gap to the left of the click-point. Clicking <b>Reset</b> re-initializes the sequence.<p> 
<dt><b>Automatic mode</b><dd>In Automatic mode the program performs the alignment using the selected algorithm. When <b>Animation On</b> is selected, each step is illustrated. The animation speed is determined by the <b>Speed</b> slider. When the algorithm is complete the user may click on a table slot to see how the algorithm chose a value for that slot.<p> 
If the user previously performed a manual alignment, comparison can be made between the manual and automatic alignments by clicking the radio buttons back and forth between the two modes. </dl> <p>
