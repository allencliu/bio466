**********************************

This instructional module can be used as a laboratory exercise in a
supervised scheduled lab, or as an "off-line" student assignment. The
content is closely coupled with the Align instructional application.
Documentation for Align can be accessed from the program's Help menu,
or separately from the application at help.html in the Doc folder.
(Installation instructions for Align are contained in this
documentation.) Students should familiarize themselves with the basics
of Align operation before working on the module.

The module is distributed in four PDF file as Parts I - IV.

    Part I introduces sequence alignment.
    Part II describes the basic dynamic programming algorithm.
    Part III discusses the scoring schemes used in sequence alignment.
    Part IV considers semi-global and local variations of the basic
    algorithm.

Each part contains worked-out examples and several exercises with
solutions. Please feel free to add your own exercises to the ones
distributed here.

Some students may find it easier to have printed versions of the
modules on their desks when working with Align on their computers.
Students may also open several instances of Align when working
exercises that require comparisons.

Development in the module closely follows the material on sequence
alignment in the textbook Fundamental Concepts of Bioinformatics by
Krane & Raymer. Other online resources follow:
